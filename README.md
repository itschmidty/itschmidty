## Hi 👋🏻 I am a Full-stack Developer.
- 🎓 Although I hold a BBA degree, three years into college software development stole my heart.
- 💼 I've had the privilege of working at companies like Yandex, Tinkoff, and Lunka Technologies.
- 💻 Currently, I'm on an adventure to build my own personal brand and digital creative agency.

### Things I explore:
- I aim to achieve a deep understanding of digital marketing and branding strategies.
- Beyond the world of code and marketing, I enjoy playing chess.
