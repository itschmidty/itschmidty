## Hi 👋🏻 I am a Full-stack Developer.
- 🎓 Although I hold a BBA degree, three years into college software development stole my heart.
- 💼 I've had the privilege of working at companies like Yandex, Tinkoff, and Lunka Technologies.
- 💻 Currently, I'm on an adventure building my own branding, digital marketing and web development studio.

### A bit about Doup Studio:
We're all about empowering businesses in the digital realm. We create beautiful websites for all kinds of folks out there. <br>
We also dig into the world of digital marketing and branding, crafting strategies that help businesses thrive in the online landscape.

### Things I explore:
- I aim to achieve a deep understanding of digital marketing and branding strategies.
- Beyond the world of code, I enjoy playing chess.
